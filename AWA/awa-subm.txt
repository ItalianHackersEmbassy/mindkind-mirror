*** Information on AWA Submissions


     A word about submissions.  Although our creative juices seem to
flow endlessly, they might suffer a dry spell once in a while.  We
know you feel our plight!  We know you understand!  So put it in
words.  Remember, your handle could be up there, and you could use the
affiliation when applying to the latest RAZOR board!  DCC submissions
to foobar, ozopilot, or alexknox anytime you see them on irc.  Or mail
submissions to:

comrade@gnu.ai.mit.edu

Don't forget to sign your article.


     We actually have a membership list.  We will update it every
issue.  You can be a member if you write something at least once a
month.  You will be placed on the membership list as soon as we
publish one of your articles.  Members will be removed from AWA
membership if they do not submit anything for AWA in the timespan of
one month.  Its not too much to ask.  The membership list is
transient.  There are only a few permanent members of AWA.  As long as
you write your a member.  Oh, and if you are a permanent member,
you'll know.

     What do you get out of being an AWA member?  You can go to bed
knowing you are kicking WareZ d00dz in the head at all times, while
also being able to put the 3ll3+ AWA logo next to your handle
every time you sign a warez flame.  If you are not a member of AWA but
use the AWA logo, we will have to crack your kitchen counter.
