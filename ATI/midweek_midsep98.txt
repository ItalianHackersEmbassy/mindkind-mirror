. . .     CRISIS
.   .        IN  THE  M U S I C   H A L L


(dateline - halfmoon, September. 1998)
PRIME ANARCHIST GOES TO THE '98 MTV   b l e e p    AWARDS.

OK, This one I had to watch on the BLEEP tube.
   I caught the last half "live" and only THEN watched the rest
on VH-1, er, uh, I mean - VHS.
   Got home late because of a gig I played at. Some little dive
bar out there in the midwest somewhere west of Chicago; but awfully
east of Jennifer Loves Wycleff's crib. But hey, it truly WAS live;
and 10% wasn't bleeped, blacked or otherwise networked censored.
   AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED HOW CONTRIVED
        (and was Madonna's owner pissed out of his blockin' head??)
              ALL THE SPONTANIONIONIOSMS WERE??? 
   Am I the only one who cares?
   
   
   This MIDWEEK CRISIS (trademarc) brought to you by:
   1) 1 racist chi-wa-wa
   2) two places to pay some "fairies with boots" twice what Cheryl
      Crow Magma deserves
   3) three or four cars which even the welders and the tranny 
      installation team members can't afford without a hefty employee
      discount
   4) and a red, white and abusive blue designer who isn't known for  
      anything besides underwear, t-shirts and some smell in a bottle
      that makes everyone sneeze half their lungs out before they 
      begin feeling horney for no known reason.
