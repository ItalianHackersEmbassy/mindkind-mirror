Thanks, Ground Zero. And now for the Prime Anarchist Productions #'s run.
PAP, as you know, is a subsidiary of NOPE and Nope, it's not Sunday. It's
Monday, September 1, 1997. 9am believe it or not. We begin our numbers run
(a short one this week) 
<jumps out of seat looking pissed> - Wait! There's that Royal "we" again.
To hell with that!! No more Royal we, no more Royal we. Long live the 
Royal we. I'm the only one writing this column, so for the rest of this
article, yours truly, Prime Anarchist will refer to himself as "I."
   heheheheh.
   We are not amused.
   OK, why so short? I didn't have a lot of time to hunt stuff down. Why you
might ask. Because "I" have been spending the last 3 days straight (almost
literally) getting the all new ATI web page started. That's right, you
heard it here first. That's right; Angelfire Communications Corporation
decided to sponsor us with a free web page. Go look at it.

                                         Wait until the 00 year. But we'd
                                         Better hurry up and put Nobody in
                                         The White House.

disclaimer: The story you are about to read is to be completely ignored.
            I wrote this while Princess Diana was merely injured in a car
            crash. She hadn't expired yet. 
            4 hours later I learned of her death.
            Dead.
            I can't make fun of the dead.
            So until someone figures out the Zombification drug and brings
            her back to life, IGNORE THE FOLLOWING:
   Princess Diana dumped her car in the Chapamaquody River last night and
lived to tell about it. She swam all the way to the Atlantic where the 
currents took her right up the east coast to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.
She was found beached next to a dumpster behind a Pizza Hut on Brookline Ave.
   Now her boyfriend didn't fare so well. He was aparently trapped in the
car until it reached the Federal Trades Commission building. He was thrown
from the car and spit onto the beach like Jonah out of the whale, pronounced
dead and promptly Knighted in a sunrise ceremony by Ted Kennedy and Chris
Dodd.
   While Princess Diana is somewhere between critical and really bad, 
Senator Kennedy is somewhere between Scarborough Beach, RI and Kennebunk ME.
