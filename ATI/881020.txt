  I'm sick and foggin tired of catagorizations and compartmental- izations.
  This is one of the few (3 or 4) negative things I've seen to come from
computer use/abuse/consumption/digestion.
  "Do you use a commodore or an atari?" was the common thought among 8bitters.
It hasnt stopped. In fact, even between the 16/32's like the ST or the Amoeba,
you see a lot of infighting. Is your modem Hayes or blah mode? 12 or 24 hundred
nibbles per nanosecond? Is your screen 80 or 132 column?
  Even among the elite, I have seen some stupid generalizations/judgments/
eyeball-chewing. Are you a hacker or a phreaker? Telenet or Tymnet? Unix or
Zenix?
  What this essay is trying to get across by the end of its writing is this:
IT DOESNT FUGGIHM MATTER!!!
  I've seen a bright individ on an apple 2+ get more resultz on my BBS than an
Amy 2000er!!! I've seen an 8bitter do power-more than your basic mac 2 freak.
  Cygnus has a good analagy for us all.  It aint the machine, says he. It's the
operator. I wonder if he still feels that way now that he's moved from his cp/m
on up to the amy 500???
  I bought my first computator for one thing only. WP!!! (word processing).
It was a portable computer that I could bring to the ball park, jot down a
few things, and then go home and print it out.
  Then I got a desktop kind of thing that could rest at home, and be there when
I wake up. Sort of like a wife. Hmmm. Somewhere before that, I already found
how I could get the two together. Then along came a nice 3/12 modem for my
desktop. Thanks to that educated 60 dollar decision, I can now grab a soda at
that ballpark, and set my laptop on the payphone and send the stuff to my
desktop.
  Something I want you to work on.
  STOP FIGHTING AMONGST YOURSELVES AND START MOVING TECHNOLOGY FORWARD instead
of worrying whether someone is a commie/atarian/amoebite/applehead/Ibeamer.
