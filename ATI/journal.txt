JOURNAL POME 1
        by prime anarchist. previously published in a 33-poem book of 
poetry entitled "I Slurp My Coffee." (c)1995

Fireguard schmireguard, I'm in the 
Choir. Colorado 1st impression:
Kansas border from plane-- looks like a 
Rock; trees and houses stuck on it.
Ski's suitcases like huge
Musket carrying bags.
Sight landing in plane?
300 miles of beach sand.
Welcome to the semi-desert.

Dry mouth, nose bleeding off & on
For 16 hours. Short of breath
On a 1 flight staircase.
Sore muscles ail all morning. From walking??
Saltless water, oxygenless air; a
Bouyanciless jellyfish float in a lake.
Responseless foto-gray glasses just stay
Dark. Closer to the sun? Crisp papertowels
And toilet paper you can write on.

Coffee houses everywhere. One 4 each 7-11.
Aztec cooking all around. Empty rivers not
Flowing under bridges; called a wash.
Jasmin tea and onion bagel in 
Ice cream parlour; ice cream
And coffee in bagelteria. Lemon
Zinger tea in mason jar over ice.

"ROCKY MOUNTAIN HAIKU:
Or Sign On Wall":
DON'T DRINK AND ROCK CLIMB--
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD
YOUR LIQUOR. GOOD DAY.
This has been ATI 70.

Dead: gone; still with us
Poiesies In Our Pockets.














JOURNAL POEM 2

I feel misplaced;
My rock used to be in the bank.
Now it's washed down the river,
Maybe at the bottom of the sea by now;
Or maybe on top of some mountain.

Whatever happened to John DeLorean? 
That aluminum car - so costly. Maybe he
Rusted, or washed into some sea.
Of obscurity. Or invested.
In fossil fuel.

A miner's head-lamp, laptop and a 
Portable computerprinter -- never mind
Walderness Pond; I'll go write in a 
Cave. Live on roots.
You mean French onion soup's not
Vegetarian?? Cheez whiz, gadzookamaluga.
Prefix: Gad. Suffix: Uga. Root: zookamal.

Do you remember cruisin' Main Street?
Smaller towns still do it.
Is this the 40's again: or what?
They probably wear sharks tooths too.
And fossils.

With dry sense of humor; who needs a towel?

Gadzookamaluga-
Webster 1958. pg 569.
(n)  ((bad expression. from early bourgeois,
Gadfly- annoying. from caveman, ugh- dunno.
Middle american for doggeral, bad poetry.)) 
Someone who can't express himself well. 
"What a gadzookamaluga." Clinically a 
Writer's block. "I'm gadzookamaluga'd
Now, go easy on me."
Someone's rhetoric simply stinks.
"Gadzookamaluga!"
Great synonym for "Bullshit."

"Dolapachont" is Navajo for "bullshit."
I used to know it in Laguna too.









JOURNAL POEM 3
        by prime anarchist. previously published in a 33-poem book of 
poetry entitled "I Slurp My Coffee." (c)1995

Old Pomes. New Pomes.
Borrowed pomes; blue pomes.
Funny pomes, sad pomes; goofy and glad pomes.
Pomes pomes. pomes pomes, eat them up - yum.

Make alliteration instead of legislation.
Ah, all's well that "and's" well-
And all are about action.
Skip, jump, lay there, run, smile, frown.
Run around, skip the jumping;
Lay there down.

Who chewed a page outa my pomes?
You're not s'posed to chew:
Eat them delicately.
Luscious, yummy, soft delicious yellow pomes.
Moist, meaty, mysterious succulent pomes.
Pomes about poets, presidents, pests
And pomes full of juice.
I eat pomes.
Do you eat pomes?
Red pomes, yellow pomes, green poems.
Don't eat the blue ones.

JOURNAL POEM 5 previously published in a 
UCONN quarterly under a true name.
fall '95.
Woman wearing topaz bolo tie
Dismantles her "NO TRESPASSING"
Unfurls her new "NO SKATEBOARDING."

Cooling off by a fake waterfall
I watch lead, rhythm and bass 
Zylophonists play "Not what it used 
To Be," their final cut-
Slices thru my heart like Swiss Army
Sawblade thru sun-melted butter.
Hold the Coke and smile, I want
RC Cola and a wince.

Slept thru half an Eagles song-
Woke up; clock saying 1189 p.m.-
2 many people w/ fake black hair-
1st Ronald McDonald was vegetarian-
Guess I woke up on the wrong side of-
The driver's seat: damn those digitals.

Dale Carnegie once said, "Plan for 
The worst -- and hope for the best."
"This isn't a bagel," he said once 
Too, "It's white bread with a hole."

Inchworms are the same, the world over:
Just a little different in size.

























JOURNAL POEM 6 by Marc Frucht

50 mete(o)rs per hour;
Quite a shower to see.
Playing Celtic music;
Drinking coffee at Java
At the Hut eating the "Longest
French fries in Colorado,"
I read "Continued On Back Flap,"
By Sue Dunham.

Chapel of the Open Air uses the
Thomas Jefferson version of 
The Bible. Pavilion protects
Overhead, logs to sit on;
Unfinished lumber lectern.
Long walks in the park, just B4 dark,
Married couple - listening to
Seperate walkman stereos
As they stroll the walkway.
Who needs canteen hiking when
7-11's every hundred yards?

Splast (n) from Coloradan - "blast"
Early Rhode Islandan "splash," to
Have a great deal of fun, wet.
"Splastic," using rubber rafts in
Said funmaking. "Splasm" having 
Simply too much water fun.
Eg: "Bring your friends over to the
Flash flood. We're having a splast."

Thanks for the etymology
Earl Grey.


















JOURNAL POEM 7 by Marc Frucht 
Write a song called "Parchese With Two Pieces Missing," 
just So the reviewer can say
"And the band played Parchese with Two Pieces Missing."
>From center lake the mountain Has powdered sugar on top:
>From 7000 feet athlete's foot falls off.
I just flew in from Aspen and boy are my lips chapped.
Shopping for goods in a snowy sleeveless thing,
Reagan shaves half his head; half for brain surgery,
Half for the press.
I just got a job in Aspen and boy, Suzy Chapstick 
Looks anorexic.
Monkery is an only business.
You ever seen a moose relieve himself?
Cruising' Denver in a kevlar sport coat, the sassafras' mittens Make me
homesick for Connecticut.
And the band played Schmaltzing Godzilla.
Papagayo's chilitos & cheese. Onion salsa's free too.
Zing. During Dogma Doug's dobro solo, Hurricane Hugo
Hit Havana hard.
Thunder & Buttons eating a buffalo burger listening to Marley's "Buffalo
Soldier" during thundershowers: veja du.
I just rode a horse from Aspen and boy are my chaps ripped.
Blue corn tortilla laced with saut_ed jalapenos- quite the bite. Like
eating at the maco shark while he's still alive. And wet. A green card
isn't white any more - it's pink. 
Only thing worse than "tennis elbow?"
Bicycle-butt.
Never mix Tang(tm) with water from a mineral spring... Explosive.
553 a.m. A cold peppermint moon, eating
Cold pizza - pineapple and peppers.
How many loggers does it take to build a cinder block
house?
Depends how many eagle nests. 
They're building a tunnel from Arizona to China.
Called a strip mine.
In a $185 leather day pack knapsack, I'll look really Bohemian, holy cow.
I just rode my bike to Aspen and boy am I chaffed.


















JOURNAL POEM 8. PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN A FEW OTHER PUBS. (not sayin
which)
Laminated escapade on Land Canoe
A 10speed. Same feeling from
Biking as paddling: freedom.
People-watching in Pueblo park.
Peaceful people, Pueblo.
Penciled onto pay phone:
Lost- a profound piece from the
Cake of liberty. Leftover
Pineapple petroglyphs.

MONAMI's the plate from El Paso county.
Must've taken a wrong turn in Albuquerque.

You know you're southwest when you 
Get the Espanol radio. Welcome to Pyebbelo.
"Miami" es Cuban por "my friend."
How do you say "move" in Cuban?
Perfecto movado, doodo.
The music's just right and the 
People are so dad bloomed nice &
Warm to each other I'm about to cry.

"3M-TA3." Write it down and
Look in the mirror. What a Witty piece of grafitty.
Homeboy holds up Motel 6: steals register,
Cash and phone. Clean getaway. Smart.
Only in Santa Fe. 
Bet I know who wrote "Eat-me" 
All over a bathroom mirror. Who knew?

Only good thing Yale ever gave America
Was fortress locks.
pinon Canon petroglyphs of the people.
Tiny writing; hardly see,
Much less read it!
Drink more coffee; you'll make it out.

Well, that's about it for ATI 78.

horsewhip a whippoorwill? Or will we wind up a watermelon whistle? Nah,
we'll
just whistle Dixie.













JOURNAL POME 9

Colorado Ave. drinkin tea
Tasting of a rusty old sewer
Sitting on Sitting Thinking Stone
Thinking of places never been to.
Strongest coffee north of Santa Fe.
Bike lock cable wedged into spokes
Like steel spaghetti: thief runs off
Into daylight yonder. Rage, I think
About, letting go -- unravelling
Bike lock. Tightening spokes to
Hand-true. A ruined cable, I ponder
Too- a saved mountain bike.
Haiku: Cap'n Crunch, walnuts,
       Gatorade and elephant
       Peanuts. Yummy. Huh?

Take a load off your mind-- your
Cerebral cortex, corpus collosum,
Cranial cavity. Your canoggin.
"They're not bald spots," says
Zac Taylor. "It's worry skin."
What a yutz.

Lady with bouffant falls like President Ford
Off a piper plane-- cologne smelling like
It cost more than my college education.
What a clutz.

Rock star tries to "pick up chick." Spandex
Shirt, leather pants, 5'4" with 5-inch heels.
You know me? I'm with that band. I'm the 
Light man, take my hand. He looks down
Her 10-year-old cleavage-less concert t-shirt.
What a putz.

Army wife tries to pick me up. Spandex shirt,
Leather skirt. 5 foot 2 blond hair with roots.
I know you. I sat at the corner with Mai Tais.
You dance real good, she says. I wasn't even
In whatever bar she's cornered. Who she thinks
I am I wondered. I look down her arm at her ring
Finger, glittering shimmeringly. Sorry, I say.
I don't date sluts.

And Sleeping Buffalo lays pensively,
Vigilant; brown and gray with white
Splotches marbled in. Hills can make
You forget what ocean would look like.
Mountains drive me nuts.

Panamania Just Cause
President says, "Operation."
Why? "Just 'cause."

New Years '90 my horoscope says
I gotta make more long distance
Calls. I wonder how much THEY 
Owe on THEIR telephony bill?

Old man on a penny farthing bicycle 
Rides to work in a business suit
Strokes waxed handlebar mustache
Before waving. Is he the one who
Sold me that motor scooter?

Gweeb (n) from Youth Underground, "Dweeb,"
Dorky, with an element of gooberishness.
IE: He's a gweeb for eating Raisonettes.

Sticky soft sugary sponge.

Rhyme schemes make 'em socially acceptable,
Rhythm makes 'em flow;
But alliteration makes 'em work,
And metaphor drives 'em home.









JOURNAL POEM 11 from the book "I Slurp My Coffee."
"Crash," wakes the soldier
Rushing outside with nothing
On but dogtags & cockleburrs.
Space shuttle goes up like a 
Sashweight; down like a 
Smashing window.

She puts on clothes and 
Consequently consumes cocoa
Crispies and canned apple
Sauce for Breakfast.
Same day, J's restaurant:
Breakfast all day.
The lard patty in toast
With an egg on it; she
Porks it down faster
Than you can say
Cholesterol.

2 nights jail for jaywalking
That's for Miss Demeanor
Fellow neonious jaywalking
Carries the maximinium of
Death.





























JOURNAL POEM 12 from the selfpublished (150 copies) "I Slurp My Coffee."
by
Marc Harry Ehrenfrucht.

Our Revolution
Seventeen seventy six:
Merely a French coup?

Dress loud and tip big.
Waiting for payday for a
Pepper pizza pie.

John Waters says he 
Wants to be Walt Disney for
Peculiar children.

Vegetarian
Chili is just perfect for
Personality.

Sometimes I put too
Many haikus in each poem;
sometimes I do not.

Banana, cottage cheese, grapefruit,
Tuna sandwich, homefries and coffee.

Sleeping too deeply to dream.
Airborne, infantry, cattle rancher
Or rodeo clown?

Woke up one morning
Wanting to run away and
Join the circus:
Then I got in my
Army uniform and 
Reported for work.

I'll see that when I 
Believe it. A play on words;
And also a haiku.

Easter on the Pearl Street Mall,
Rich carries a piano on his 
Back. 4 wheel dolly and a 
Shoulder harness.
Upright piano on the
Sidewalk for tips.

Found in coffee houses.

The moon. (pl) treppies.

(adv) treppyish.
You mean I'll make twelve 
A day tax free singin songs
On a sidewalk now???
I drank a bottle of acid
Rain water -- how come nothing
Happened except the mens room?
Whatever happened 
To the Frito Bandito?
"Homemade song," he says.
I wonder why I
Always look out a
Window while I brush my teeth
Wherever I am.

Colorado rainbows are just
Green, yellow and a lot of red.
Your seat can be used as a 
Flotation device.
Center yourself in the botanical
Garden, hands in pockets, head
Tilted back, eyes closed, staring
At sun. Cures allergies.
Ingredients: herbs,
Rhubarb, strawberries, spices,
Nectars and flowers.

Perigree moon.







JOURNAL POEM 14 BY MARCO

Coffee buzz at Denny's 4AM.

How do you outrun a storm on a 10speed?
Ride really hard Buck, and don't look back.
Ask a local ahead of time, when is
Thunder's first most likely crack.

Mexicali tofu and a hot potato salad.
New England chowder and a quesedilla.
Salad, soup & sandwich bar sumptous.
Home of the perfect hummus.
What's in a guacamole salad?
Can I get my espresso in a to-go cup?

A sagebrush tumbleweed 
Squeezes out under a Ford Falcon;
Bounces up toward my face
Then around over my head.

Cripple Creek or Bust.

If you don't want a watch tan:
Then don't wear a watch.






























JOURNAL POEM 15 by Prime Anarchist aka Marco Capelli

Hill climb.
      up a hill;
     up a hill;
    up a hill;
   up a hill;
  up a hill;
 up a hill;
Up a hill.
You can't find good clam 
Chowder up a hill.
Great cod, but lousy chowder.
2 stroke oil: that'd get you
Up a hill. Or take a cog.

There's 575 lefts in 3/4 of a mile.
Are there any fossils of people
Up a hill? Or just fish?
Blisters: Don't shoogoo (tm) sneakers
If you'll be climbing up a hill.
Red zinger iced tea.
Throw these shoes to the rats.
Sunset from a foothill.
Setting behind the hill.

Chapstick will be 
Crucial up a hill.
Calves hurt: heels too.
Blister the size of Boulder.

NORAD's storming pretty
Hard down there.
Barr Camp -- 4 bucks a night
In an A-frame,
Half way up her purple
Mountain's majesty.

I'm so high it's 
Raining sideways.
Up a hill.
2 miles.
Barefoot.
Both ways.

Australian Hoki fish.
Permanentate is a verb.
Hey cullinder-brain, I say
A toasted bagel and cream
Cheese is just not complete
Without sprouts and tomatoes. 
Wrist burns on motor scooter:

Would've been way worse.
And the gasoline was green;
It's usually blue out here.
You notice these things.
Clam cakes will get worse
And worse the wester you get

Salesman convalescing in Saybrook;
Swedes congested in sarcasm. And
Seaweed collecting by sewer-systems.

Where ladies room's nothing 
More than a men's room with
The urinals duct-taped shut.
Cedar wood and mud warm and
Cozy... toasty dry despite
Winter under and above clay.
How do you reclaim a uranium 
Mine?!? City park? Golf -
Course?? Sod farm???
Coffee and a warm sweetroll
At Tuba City Truck Stop.

If your herb garden grows 
Slow and late it's a thyme delay.
Did you know that "wonton"
Spelled backwards is "not now?"
What d'ya call a whatchamacallit
Shop? Just that.
Last All-Hallows-Eve the baby
Sitter went as a leather  mouse
What're you?? I'm a mud bog.
Or was that a ground hog?
Tse Bonito and Window Rock...
Ancient tourist traps...
Oraibi... the oldest...
Taos, Tuscon, or Taylor...
Which is trendier?
Electric cello: like Woodie Guthrie
Walking into Karaoke nite at Lulu's 
Luscious Locust, 14th and Ave. X.
C&W music in a major way...
Conway Twitty's where I get 
Off this ride. & change channels.
 
6-Foot Wedgie plays a gig at 
The Russian Lady restaurant.
Que concept... like cranberry nut
Frybread. Paul Harvey is like the
Faded fotocopy of Will Rogers.

Woke up with either pigsnot and
Venom, vim and vinegar or Just 
A whole bunch of vigorous
Vitality. Or was it just the
Vidal Sassoon???
Homemade blood sausage. Takes guts
To eat. Taste good, like a tender
Spinach leaf. I'd try anything 
Once... that was my once, like a
Sliced intestine full of leftovers.
If squash is 1 of the 3 sisters,
She must be the short one.

Bacitracin can't compete w/ pinon pine sap.

And JC Penier, clothier to the 
Mallrat knows nothing of KMarticus,
The bluelight king of Upholstry;
Neither knows thing of braintanning.

So Navajo Nation's only radio station
Plays hit kicking country. Western.
You know you need a bath when
The sheep won't let you in the pen if even 2 let them out.










































JOURNAL POEM 23 by Marco Capelli
 
        Pomegranite.

Does anger have taste?
Car's down 'til roads clear.
December the freezin' season.
2-8 a.m. only good times to drive;
Least bit of thaw slides you 
        Off-road.
Big Mountain, thrown off a horse;
Hauling water & hay for the elders.
Fixing hay shack, chopping wood.
VW microbus' 1st gear freezes stuck.
'Til 10am or so. (so cold & dry.)
Jan. 7, 1992. 9am. Lamb born to
The sheep who looks like Don King.
Denny makes coffee for wider eyes;
And 85th monkey follows the wind
Pondering the 4 directions. Red, 
White, yellow and black; Nevada,
Mexico City, Washington, or Spain.
James buys Edensoy in Winslow's 
Art Colony Fish Hatchery Homeless
Veterans Shelter. Vanilla's good;
Original's not. Run cooperatively
Sells bikes and skateboards too.
Customary cleaning woodstove each
Sunrise. Ash is for the outhouses
Always keep hot water on in case
Company comes. And the door key 
Hangs from lower branch of a tree. 
What's yellow, black and white?
        Uranium.
Headache and much noise. "Don't herd
The sheep near the uranium wash," 
Auntie says, "makes them act wild."
Well, you would too if you had those
        Headaches.
Told my guardian angels are spiders,
Whales, porcupines, buffalo, crows,
Badgers, turtles, bats & dolphins.
Roasted pinons; like chestnuts the
Size of roasted coffee beans.
"Nova" means food in Hopi.
"O" is yes in Navajo. "Ba" is bread.
        Go figure.
So what's red, white, yellow and black?
        Pomegranite in a wash full of
Uranium.



JOURNAL POEM 24
Cappuccino.
Monkey and Bull make meal of
Pomegranite, potatoes, pineapple & peppers.
LL Zamenhof worked Pepsi's graveyard
Shift til the day he died. Poetic.
Death not for lack of irony.
For growing calamity, asks Esperanza,
Does one need fertilizer?
Removes tongue from cheek.
1477. Chris visits Iceland inquiring
As a wannabe Portugese picking up
Waterfront gossip of "the NewFound Lands."
Looks like Lawnmower Man on valium.
Vacation - Grape Cod. Dwelling on payola,
Punkrock, and plasma in Adobe Abode.
Hystorically, a bladder bag full of bull.
Mother Earth, you are beaux, bela, belle,
Beautiful - Where's Dr. Esperanto
When you NEED him??

Peabody Coal purchases Cavenham 
Forest for a copper penny.
Mrs. Farthing leaves a pie on her porch for
The plutonium miners. Make mine a strip so
Rare IT'S STILL IN THE GROUND.
Spineless as a Portugese Man O'War, now if
That ain't the scumm calling the scummsucker scummy.
Sage tea makes sore throat to merely a wet
Groggy flemmy thing; yet Dire Wolf offers
12-page thesis on Yak semen.
Can God hear you in a Hindu Ashram?
"Yes," yells Yayo. She's 12 and SMARTER than you.
Fiesta. Laguna March 19, 1992
They say you'll be led by children.

Haiku: Zuni Moisture Dance
 Mudhead Kachinas - Laura,
   Yayo, HasKey Tso.

Sweatlodge. Madrid, NM
2 FAS children flying a kite.
Filthy fake fony false hair follicles
Now fact thanks to Rogaine.
Or was that Reagan??
Nancy's war-on-drugs:
Rhymes with moron thugs.
 
Open Mike is playing at the Chez What Cafe. 
Who IS this Open Mike?
Just some honest Joe?
Stench fries and fillet of potatoes at
The Full Spoon Cafe.

And Bo Diddley's cook wears wine-red 
Dingos pouring sherry in Mrs. Farthing's Chowder.
Pampa, TX. Letting go of Police Brutality -
Release, relax, relief.
2:30 a.m. Katy reads poetry for tips at the 
Omaha Greyhound.
Makes 2-bucks on "Bernalilo Blues."
Mytho-philosophical street poems.
How do they make coffee in Nowata?
Strong - same as Coffeeville.
Trivia question: who's face on $5
Foodstamp??

      Thomas Jefferson or Johnny Cash?

Movado watch with moon minute hand,
I straddle the corner of Florence
& Normandy contemplating cops.
A house full of cat-tails never falls;

And Medina pours Mecca a 20 oz. cup of
Mocha java.


































JOURNAL POEM 25 
Pour you a cup of columbian in
Coffeeville, Kansas; thinking,
Now here's a town more worthy
Of that "Beantown" nickname.

Them badlands'll take your
Feet if you'll let 'em.
They call'm "El Morro."
He's taken dogs, horses,
Tiretreads & wagonwheels.
So, watch your feet.   

Methodist pastor folds his feet
Under his legs, smoking the pipe
With the circle -- not preaching.
With the people -- purely
Prayerful purely fellowship.
Powerful pipe that Chanupa.

After smoking is almost always eating.
Over frybread and milkweed greens,
Zuni children teach me every swear 
They know from their own language.

"OUR MISSION - YOUR FUTURE," warns
Fort Leavenworth's front sign.
Barely legible 'neath all those
Wirebarbs. Hmmm, I think. Telling...
























JOURNAL POEM 26 

Rosebud in July.
Singing for the medicine man.
Said it made his heart smile.
Helped him think of other things.
All the doctors know about is
Transfusions and sharp stuff.
Oh, and pharmaceutical 
Petroleum product pills too.
Omaha medicine man plays my
Guitar and makes it sing.
Had a guitar, but gave it away
Said to a young guy who needed 
It more: he's just beginning.
Nice sitting back hearing my 
Guitar playing someone else.

Black bean burrito at Red Herring
Coffeehouse Champaign, Illinois.
Black squirrel sits in front of
Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard
And Liquor Cabinet; eating her
Out of house and home.
A black and white dog
Pee-ing on your car-tire
Is a Creator sent clown.
Just say "Thank you."

Black and yellow banana with
Cuba sticker on Santee rez.
Winnebego PowWow. 15 year old
AT Red Cross booth oggles Smiles-
A-Lot from "Dances With Wolves."
I talk him into autographing her 
One dollar bill. Visiting her,
Almost causes her a coronary.
Bet he breaks a lot of hearts:
Old Nathan, especially with his
Big Lakota smile.
Sing to a red-winged black bird-
He'll follow from Dakota to Ohio.

Guthrie, IA - Much 
Different from Guthrie, OK.
(How?
See for your self.)

JOURNAL POEM 28 

Can something taste brown?
Or does "Obla Di, Obla Da"
Just mean life goes on?
Some guitarist once told me
"Silence is a part of music."

Hot Cocoa awaiting sugar buzz.
You mean a Boston creme pie
Donut is NOT health food???

Eggrolls - like crispy cooked coleslaw pizzas.
1950's nunnery - like army boot camp for women.
"Earthquakes are allergic reactions to
Condominiums," says Robin Williams
On TV's Mork and Mindy show. Laughing,
I purchase "A Cultural Study of America,
1993," by Frank Lee at ArtRock Bookseller
in Denver. Was a blank book.

Cantata with midi music -
Like kareoke-4-Christ.
Movement of the mall?
Cooking canned cactus;
Comedians R 2 meta4ical  2day.

Where's rodeo clown college;
Or can I just show up?
Over haddock, coleslaw and coffee
In Hartford Hojos, I read
"EXTRA THICK SHAKE: Living In
Balance In An Over-Do-It Society,"
By Mark Weisenheimer.

I'm a gonna be sweatin' and jettin'

Douse with vinegar 4 remembrance.
Cedar sage sweetgrass & tobacco.
"All milk and diapers should be 
Free for the taking," says

JOURNAL POME 30
Quote: "I get to do something
       For a living that if I
       Wasn't doing it for money
       I'd do it anyways."  -- Lyle Lovett

Safe and warm.
Fritos and popcorn entrenched
In my couch. Nothing agrees with
Stomach more than peanut butter
And banana on toasted
Whole wheat bread.

Deli & Dawgs Diner -- would you eat there???

Violence impacted to society;
Embedded in life.
No capo, slide, fuzz pedal or 
Delay - no fingerpicks or 
Teleprompter, just play.
Eugene O'Neill wallops the skipper
With words and rocks the boat,
Frank Sinatra "does it [his] way"
Rooted in divine inspiration,
He claims.
Apple falls on head and
Turns lightbulb on jouncing
Thought, slurping coffee
Like a pretentious snit.
Jogging memory with a
Jarful of Jolt cola.
Orange lentils & linguini
Lodged in a sore throat.
Don't sop the heat of hot chili
With cucumber; use bread: good buffer.

Shelter Wagon is hospitality on a horse. 
Running from river to river
Haven't seen hay for 30 miles:
How come I have hayfever??

Run chasing your shadow
All morning; then you can 
Chase it home all afternoon.








JOURNAL POME 31
Blue Moon 1993.
Jogging: a fall, spring
And Summer thing.
Computers are so frustrating.
Lemme quote "argh," from Charlie Brown.
Having bought mushrooms fresh
Right outa manure, my wife and 
I swear no mushrooms anymore.
Smoking sage and tobacco
Keeping allergies at bay.
Awaiting my guitar in the mail.
United Way reminds me
Way too much of Amway.

Freudian schlepp- (v) to go somewhere
Not remembering why you got there.
But staying to find out anyways.
Which full moon do you like best?
Avacados to break your fast.
Almost full? Full full?
Or the waney one??
Canoe-ing        under the       up to the
Mystic river;    drawbridge      seaport.

Hanuman Temple, Taos.
Half Moon, October. 
Navajo tea; looks like
Chinese twig tea.
Tastes though, of lemon-
Grass honey-covered.

Defendant enters courtroom
With bag of sage, Bible
And a notebook. Maybe
The DA has rabies.


















JOURNAL POEM 32
       by Prime Anarchist.
Harmonarchy, a house hoping 
For harmonious anarchy.
Got a Christ room and everything.
Waking up I ask my wife wonderfully,
Is margarine magnetic?
If you're quiet, you can hear
The owls go to sleep.
Just a random thought
Happily hazarded.

So there we were thinking "here we
Are slapdash in an unplanned spot."
Gentrification -- a $10 word. If you
Can't afford it -- means racism.

Will the Yucatan pope show up at the
Vatican peninsula? Expecting him
Is like Pope on a hope.
2 Heyoka moons each month. Sometimes 3.
If you own a dish you might see 
Him applying his clown white,
Or noxeeming it off. Dare I call it
Papal soap? Hope not -- nope.
Diet pancakes in New Rochelle reduces
Stresses from NYC driving.
Half moon, heyoka -- a spiritual slap
In the face. More fun than anything
Pious, pompous, or pathetically
Prudish any day.
Fact, a clown each day makes
For a nice clean smile.
Even better than soap.




















JOURNAL POEM 33
Dedication: Juan & Edgar: Father & Son.

Nothing rhymes with viener schnitzel
3 turtles walk gardenward out
Of the north seeking vegetation.
Heyoka moon wanes. 3 questions:
Must war tear every square
Foot of the earth?
When will the blood stop spilling??
Who left out Revelation to John 22:22???

So there we were thinking,
"Here we are."

Direct non-violent confrontation
Door County should make
Cherry flavored potato chips.
Can't taste as bad as the trees smell.

Cinco de Mayo
 Carbon monoxide
  Deisel truck drives by
   Jogger coughs once more;
    Rain makes it smell worse
     Sick to his stomach
      May 5th - his first run.

Washing hands and face in the lower
Spring each morning -- a good time
To see animal tracks.
Surely you share this spring.
Turn thirty really close to the
Vernal equinox while de-icing the
Windshield at LaGuardia airport.
Hyssop cleans the temples.
Mall full of beer-bellied men
& anorexic-looking women makes for
Feeling sick and sorry for society.
Mecca and mime sit silently saying, "..."

Polka Haiku:
Learning new songs on
Accordian, guitar, voice,
Reworking old ones.

Gadzookamaluga!
Chubbs says he's waiting
For Vatican III in 3-D.
"So what's a soy rabbi?" I ask
Receiving lesson about the over-
Specializing of everything american.
"I'm in charge of health foods,"
He says, "herbs, anything to do with

What's good for you -- shampoo's
Soaps, etc."
Oy, soy rabbi.

Wisconsin. Like a borscht
Without brussels sprouts.
