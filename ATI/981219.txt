Hello, welcome to ATI. This is issue 158. But of course,
who's counting? We begin with Prime Anarchist's weekly 
column, then we have letters to the editor, then our
phemus #'s run, then assorted other wild raucus caucus
stuff. Happy particles of him peach mint.

CLINTON WAGS DOG
pRiME aNArChISTs CoLUmN.
THURSday 1pm EDT.
Strong statement to every member of the MEDIA:
  You suck.
  How many dead? Wounded?! How many homeless.
The war has been raging for scores of hours now and  
nobody knows or cares. You have each broken the 
fundamental principles of your field!!!
  Have you no shame?
  You are all fired.
  The war will not be televised. If you cannot be troubled
with wrestling over the death-count; struggling over the 
difficult details that must be minded at all costs, if the
sublime beauty of the war, the night sky over baghdad,
stuff like that is more important to you than the facts,
then go home.
  You suck.
  Go home.

part 2. (final part) Bob Livingston,
What's with this "6 months" doo doo?
You're resigning? Go home today and shut up.
Leave your office - go home. Pack up your stuff.
Take your Columbia State University diplomas 
off my walls and go home.
Do not pass go, do not collect 6 months pay.
Go directly to home.
You whining little maggot.
  You want my opinion, let's bring every Senator
and Congressperson in under oath and play 20 
questions. If any of them DON'T LIE, why, we'll
work with all 5 (five) of them. 
   Clear the bench.
   Bob Livingston, Shut up.
