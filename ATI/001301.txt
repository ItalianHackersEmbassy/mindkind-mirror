Hola, I'm prime anarchist reporting from the 
Anarchic Circle and this is my column for 
ThirstDay, 1-13-00. 
  Overheard on radio. "How come teachers have to
take their skateboards every year?"
  Nepotism Watch: Alex Alda. Alan? Kiernan Culkin.
Macauley?
     CIDER HOUSE RULES: Homer's Odyssey.
  A great metaphor for both sides or neither side.
Your tool to make your choice freely -- without
fear, persecution or reactionary stupidity.
  John Irving may have written the 20th Century's
only real American Classic. - just my opinion. Has
anyone seen the movie yet? I hear Eryka Badu's a
hottie in it. I read the book.
  "TB is spread when a person with active TB 
coughs, sings, or speaks and you breath the 
contaminated air," says a poster on the wall
where I'm waiting to see the doctor. 
  Imagine being told you can't sing anymore? I can't
grasp that on ANY level. Wow, yuck. Inthunkable.
ADBUSTING. You've got two table parts you want to
use sandwiching one or two leaves from last holiday,
but they're sunbleached. It's time to blend them in,
isn't it?
  CUE-TIP#5. Take the peels from a lemonade you just
made from scratch. Boil them with one or two cups of
water for 20-30 minutes. Find a 100% cotton rag, and
dunk it in the hot lemonwater once it's just cool
enough to not scald. Rub and rub and watch the magic.
  Of course, you COULD always buy 2 or 3 rounds of
commercial products - but brace yourself for the 
extra elbow grease, asthma, eczema and allergies.
FOR THE RECORD: Prime Anarchist has never owned or
operated a Mont Blanc pen.
  Prime saying, have an ice day.
