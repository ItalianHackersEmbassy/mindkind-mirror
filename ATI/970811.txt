OK. This is about all for ATI87. I'll leave you with this poem dedicated to
the revolution in the Congo. Is it any wonder there's some oil down there?

               THE OIL MYTH.
               (c) 1998. Prime H. Anarchist

               Wars and rumors of war
               Oil and rumors of oil
               
               I've got a girl for you tonite,
               I tell Dennis Rodman;
               After the game,
               You know
               You and her...
               "Is she UGGGGGLY?" is his
               Only question -
               For beauty, is an asset.
               Can be measured, manipulated manhandled
               & capitalized upon.

               Mr. Speaker, I say, Mr. Prez, Mrs. Prez:
               I yield my thyme and beg to reserve
               It back just long enough to 
               Tell you about a 
               New small country.
               Looking for democracy, freedom,
               Help from US, advisors, politicians,
               Maybe help to someday grow big and
               S T R O N G
               Through open, American monitored
               Elections.

               Are they oil-less, you ask me.
               They ask me, she asks me.
               Mrs. Speaker, for oil is an asset.
               Can be sized, sounded for, measured,
               Sucked, raped and capitalized upon.

               'Cause if she ugggggly---
               Won' give her my time no how.

               For if they LACK oil,
               We're JUS' nah INTRIST'D.

               Oil
               And rumors
               Of oil.
