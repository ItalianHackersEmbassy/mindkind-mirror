To Beat The Devil: Parenting In Modern America
  By Patrick Moore
Part 3 (ed note : 2 and 1 are in the last two ati's)

"Parenting In The New Economy"

You've seen the headlines: "Economy Strongest in 40 Years"...
"Unemployment Lowest In Decades"...that sort of thing. From the 
way they read, you'd think we had money flowing out of our pockets. 

However, there have been more layoffs and plant closings in the past 
10 years than in previous history. Yet we see optimistic stories and 
headlines. 

My question is, WHO IS BENEFITING MOST?

Well, if you're in senior management, chances are you've done 
pretty well. And, if you're a CEO, if your company closed a plant 
in the US and moved the operations to Mexico or China, you've done 
outstanding.

But what if you're in the Rank-And-File? Well, in all probability, 
you're worse off. Even if you're doing as well as you did 10 years 
ago, chances are you're having to work longer hours to keep up. 

Where does this leave time for family? It doesn't. 

"Well, if they weren't so obsessed with wealth they would have 
time for their families", some say. "What about stay-at-home moms? 
That women's lib thing really screwed up things" "What about....???"

What about it? Here's the deal.

It is a fact that most new jobs pay well below the poverty level. 
And it's a truism that two incomes are needed just for essential 
items. Even if a job pays decent, overtime is not an option. You 
either have to "work over" or face disciplinary action. If you tell 
your boss you have to take care of your kids, more than likely you'll 
hear "That's not our problem."

It's no secret that so-called "pro-family" politicians have enabled 
corporations to abuse, if not ignore, worker rights. Who gives a hoot 
about families? Not your representative. Not your congressman. Not 
your boss. So, it's up to YOU.

How do you fight back? 

Well, for one, put your priorities in order. What do you want out of 
life? Which is more important, getting a big paycheck or raising a 
healthy child? Don't get me wrong, big paychecks are OK. They come 
in handy sometimes. But if you work over constantly, you may need to 
look at changing jobs. Too much overtime can be harmful to your family 
life. 

I worked at a job where overtime was an ordinary thing. The 8-hour 
workday was the exception rather than the rule. 12-hour days were 
common. In fact, there were employees who worked MONTHS (yes, you 
read right: MONTHS) without a day off. Some volunteered, to be sure, 
but most were forced to come in. 70-84 hour workweeks sometimes 
were standard. And, the company didn't think any better of you 
afterwards either. After a while of this, my health started giving 
way, and now I have permanent damage in my thoracic spine. I missed 
time with my wife and son to help the company, and my reward was 
permanent spinal damage.

There is a trend called "downshifting" where people leave the 
high-pay, high stress job they were at and willingly take a pay 
cut and work jobs where the stress is lower. And, they forsake 
(or pay off) the high-priced "toys" that necessitated the extra 
income. 

People who downshift take a look at what is the absolute minimum 
to live on. And all too frequently there's a lot that you can do 
without. Don't misunderstand, if you have a black Acura Integra 
with 2 more years of payments, you would do well to pay it off 
first. Chances are, Acura won't understand if you voluntarily 
took a job with lower pay knowing you had a payment to make 
every month. And, ferkrissakes, STAY AWAY FROM PAYDAY LOAN, 
CHECK CASHING, OR TITLE LOAN PLACES. Those places will put 
you in far worse financial shape.  

Now, you might ask, "What about the children?" Good point. 

Kids today, more so than any other time in memory, are bombarded 
with advertising. Nike shoes, Pepsi, Nintendo...those companies 
pay a LOT of money to get their message to your child. Materialistic 
attitudes make for HUGE profits. A parent who works long hours just 
to finance unnecessary or trendy items is enabling a materialistic 
attitude. 

I grew up without Nike or Nintendo.. and I had a lot better time 
without them. So can you. So can your child. How?

Take them to the library. Go on a road trip. Look at family albums. 
Play music together. Spend time together!

Your child will appreciate it.
