  / ATI -- YOUR HACKER-ZINE  OF HOPE \
 /  (Not that the others aren't...    \
 \------------------------------------/

Hello there, and welcome to ATI 95. It's Sunday,
7:30 EST. (ed note: correction. It's Tuesday 830am.
Same Timezone) This has been a labor of love.
[frustrated grin] S'what I get for even mentioning issue 9. 
Karma there. OK...) I was GOING TO Compose this on a MacSE
I'm babysitting, but I'm still a little spooked about trying
that on anything Apple/Commodore/Atari since way back in the
days of issue 9. If you  do a hotbot or yahoo search for ATI
issue 9 you'll see what I mean. 
   Anyhow I'm Prime Anarchist and I'll be your guide through
this wacky edition of Activist TimeSignatures Ingratiated.
As you probably know by now, ATI 94 had really wide recirculation
and AWESOME response. In fact, many people around the world took
its parody of S.P.A.M. (which stands for Some People Act Mellow)
quite seriously. I guess I should've added my Post Office Box
afterall. My friend Jeff said I'm the next Castro, whatever THAT
means. Anyhow, we got lots of good stuff in store for you. We'll
start with Ground Zero's column and then on to some numbers
running and calendars.
If you want back issues, t-shirts, hats, cap 'n crunch whistles
