Hello,
The parody in ATI 248 was not written by the whole
group which was implied when the byline was left
out of the final broadcast copy of the zine.
Merritt Bussiere wrote it.
  If you keep this issue anywhere, please consider pasting
the correct copy onto the oversight, ok?

Thank you,

THEY'RE REPUBLICRATS
to the tune of the Beatles' "You Can't Do That"
  words by Merritt Bussiere

   G
Elections are upon us and it's such a pain,

G                                 G7
The 2 major parties, Man, they're both the same

              C7                          G
They're gonna let you down, and leave you flat

          D7              C7              G - D7
Because I told you before, they're Republicrats.
