HOW TO ANNOY A CLERK: At 2AM On A
Week Night. 
             by prime anarchist
  Before shutting the door behind 
you, look at the sticker on the 
door-jam that shows you're 5'7" 
tall in technicolor blue and red. 
  Shout out that you're 5'10" and
insist that their chart is wrong.
(unless of course you ARE 5'10", then
insist you're something else -- your
pick)
  Suggest the person who put it up
must've gotten ahold of some bad crack.
Tell them they'd better have it
corrected by the next time you come 
back or you're going to call the BBB.
  Don't forget to tell them you're just
kidding at some point, or you might 
ruin their trip.
  Remember to thank them and tell them
to have a nice day. Mean it, even if
you get a sense they don't.

Greetings and welcome to ATI179.
Activist Turning-Points International.
SunDay May 23, 1999. It's 4:30 pm. Do 
you know where your politicians are?

Here's the Activist Times Publisher's
Column, 

  I see and hear my God recognizes yours.
Can you say the same about "your's?"
  Just a question.
  I'm watching "MOTHER THERESA: In The
Name Of God's Poor."
  Can I tell you how weird it is to 
view this, tears rolling down my
cheeks and every time a doorbell or
phone rings at the shelter I live in
and run, I see Ted Kennedy's fat shiny
Oil Of Olay face on C-Span2 discussing
Juvenile Crime bills whenever I hit STOP?
Cough, cough, tus, tus. Sounds like old
Eddie has TB. Nice glasses by the way.
Do they cost more than my life? How many
meals could I cook with that gorgious
silk tie of yours that attempts to 
colorize your grey face and dark puffy
eyes? How many silk ties do you own, 
Ted. How many coats? 
  I don't dare say half of how I feel:
I'm not allowed to judge.
  You point at percentages of mothers
and fathers on an easle, all red, white
and blue looking; looking like Ross
Perot, Ted. Ted, Ted, I wish I could
shake you, you're not hearing, you're
not seeing, you're not asking ANY OF
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. Shut up and listen.
   Feed the poor Ted. Boston, Hartford,
Providence Ted. Brooklyn, Worcester,
Bridgeport. Feed the hungry Ted. Shut
up and sell your tie. Cook a meal.
You are no help thus far, Ted. 
Represent us! Listen to your heart. 
Feed the poor. If you don't have the 
courage to truly speak for your people,
than at least have the courage to step
down and let someone who can: do.
   That said, that expressed, I change
the channel so I no longer have to 
watch this verbal shit every time I
pause. Yuck, feck, blech. 
   A good juvenile justice bill? Feed
children free. No strings attached.
But you all aren't ready for that yet,
are you? Have a nice meeting you
yuppie pukes!
  I can't recommend this movie enough,
by the way, I didn't mean this as a 
movie review but here goes. I've cried
at least 6 times now, and she hasn't even
gone from Sisterhood to Motherhood yet.
Holy wah. What a good movie.
   I didn't know she was born in Albania.
She was nine when her dad died. Hmmm.
  Attn: NATO, take a letter. 

Dear England,
Dear US. You desecrate Princess Diana
with every smart bomb you insert into
Serbia region. Can't you see this?
Don't you hear? Don't you feel? Your
bi-lateral genocide is not working.
It accomplishes nothing but suffering
and death, destruction and desecration.
How many songs must I sing you before
you face your demons America, England,
Canada. NATO, the people calling you
NAZI are bitter, they are resentful.
I harbor no fear, no bitterness or
resentment. Nothing but love when I
tell you this.
   Name of God, NATO. When will the
bloodshed end? How about show me one
tiny sign?
   How about closing the SOA. How about
searching your heart for a peaceful
solution in Serbia, in Iraq, in Somalia,
Lebanon, Timor, Tibet; in Chiapas.
On the Navajo reservation. I make no
distinctions, Amerika. Shame on your
each and every seperation. Each bomb.
Each starving human on this planet.
Shame shame. Thank you, thank you,
thank you. Just search, you'll find
it. You're not looking hard enough.
   Oh and Secretary Cohen. 
Take a short note. 
You suck.
   Love,
Prime Anarchist
