hola hermanobrothers and hermanasisters,
happy fullmoon. as i say every bigwidemoon, "luna! i take no
responsibility for the things i'm about to say and do. wet, 
tidal forces are upon me and i can't possibly claim to control
any of it... 
i'm prime anarchist and rather than write a column for this week,
i'll paste in a letter i wrote to my friend in Swiss Hell. It has
wider appeal than just his inbox, so i figured i'd share. 
(alright, who sarcastically thanked me for sharing...)

SCHOOL OF AMERICAS NOTES by Prime Anarchist
Hey There,
If they used a wide enough camera to show a guy with a 
fugazi t-shirt and an olive drab kokopeli minnesota hat 
that was me. I saw that the next nite and I think CNN went 
narrow whereas Fox had me in there. So I was probably
just "stage left" of him looking chubby, nervous and excited 
about what came next. 
   That was perhaps one hour before we stormed the gates and
pretty much busted down Jericho, Babylon and Bill Gates' house. 
OK, I exaggerate a bit, but it felt really good to watch them 
cave when we were three times as many people as they 
prepared to contain and ignore.
