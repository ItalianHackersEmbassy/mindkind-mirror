And in real news, one year from today, 1/3 of Canada will finally be
ruled by the indigenous people who live there. Some people call them
Inuits, some call them Eskimos, but the indigenous people in charge
there, making up 85% of the 26,000 people who live there say, "Rules.
We will have Nunavat.
   (a prime anarchist comment. That's beautiful. Especially since
    in 1992 the Canadian government announced this will come about
    "immediately." Those Kanuks are almost as boggledy bogged as
    we are!!!")


mighty hinge: great place for a prime anarchist opinion column, 
wouldntcha think?
  I watched 3 minutes of Roller Derby on CLASSIC SPORTS NETWORK (tm)
yesterday while I waited for my oatmeal to boil. Whatever happened
to Roller Derby? That was some weirdass schitt. Looked like an excuse
for men and women with feathered hair and bad makeup jobs to beat each
other up wearing expensive bad disco clothing. Round and round they go, 
up and down, up and down. Almost reminds you of bad 70's porn, eh? 
(OK, Bill Hicks you get two posthumous checks for $7.)

And a repetition of the ATI mission statement. We'll try to print
this every 7 or 8 issues, so we're all on the same "sheet of muzak."
           ATI MISSION STATEMENT
                    by Prime Anarchist.

There is only 1 acceptable purpose for technology:
Simply?
To improve life.
Lives of people, plants animals; people in jail,
people in the air, people in the water.
Winged and legged. "Things" that just set there. 
Every single atom on Mother Earth is sacred.
If any technology works against one single
thing's harmony with another:
YOU'RE USING IT WRONG.
"Make your adjustments and get back to me."

ATI, Where a PARADIGM beats a Royal Flush!!!
