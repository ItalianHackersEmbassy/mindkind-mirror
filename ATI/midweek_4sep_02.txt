Activist Times, Zine. Between issues 326 and 327.

Wednesday, 4sep02. 10pm.

It seems like all hell is breaking loose in 
Caracas, Venezuela.

Secret conference calls have been uncovered
between George W Bush and people in the Turkish
government, where the US is offering half of 
Iraq's "booty" if they will only pretend to
be allies of the US throughout the upcoming
unilateral war on Basrah and Baghdad.

Apparently Romania has been offered something
sweet also. Does anyone know if it's even 
viable for the US gov't to stage some of the
war from Romania? What else could the EEUU be
needing from Romania besides a simple position
paper saying "yo dudes, like, killing iraqui
babies is kewl?" 

Anyhew, that's all we got, but it seemed 
important to throw this all out right away.
A regular zine issue (is that 327? yeah.)
should follow shortly.

Sincerely,
Prime Anarchist
