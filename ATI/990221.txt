PRIME ANARCHIST RANTS.

Hendrix' "Let me stand Next 
To Your Fire" for the Pontiac 
Sunfire? Oh my god let me barf!
I've got three words:
   You people suck.
Lauren Bacall. Wow. Go Lauren, 
go lauren, go lauren go. Anyone
ballzy enough to tickle Larry
King's nose on Live. Wow.
  How long can you work at a place
that plays Beethoven's 5th every
time you enter something correctly
at the cash register, Ride of the
Valkyries when the fries are done
and "Zzzzt! (wrong answer)" when
something doesn't add up. Aargh!
 Mariah Carey, they still let you
talk??? 
  "What's wrong with asking people
to not discuss private details of
things that are private to you?"
Yes! She said that. OK Mariadolt,
Let's discuss private details
that aren't.
  Heinz up 1/4
 Laying off 4,000.
Pssst... 12,000 might've gotten
you a whole point. 
 You peeps suck 2.
    Hey, I don' mean 2 B regi-zine-
o-phobic, but I'm gonna make it in
Green Bay 'cause NY sux.
  Lemme repeat something 'cause it
"gots th' replay value:" 
The hair, 
the cigarette 
and the Stratocaster: 
How many ways 
can you play 
the Em scale 
in just two positions?
prime sick and tired!!!
