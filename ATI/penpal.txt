Ah, you're a brave soul; or a cocky hacker perhaps.

Maybe you're more curious by nature than a twice-dead cat. 

Any way, you came to the right place. This cute little t-phile is
a hacker FAQ that will help you implement what you've learned all
around ATI land. And so functional.

Here we go.

1) Always use ctrl-alt-del in a windows environment.
2) Never strike the backspace key while holding down TAB.
3) Always title textfiles in ALL-CAPS.
4) Never take a urine test without drinking much olive oil before hand.
5) Sometimes use yellow sticky notes to torment your boss.
6) Don't ever use yellow sticky notes (referred to as YSN's from here
on in) to blow your nose.
7) Never french kiss on the first job interview.
8) Hardly ever wear Nikes.
9) Often ask questions.
0) Always question authority.

And don't forget to buy
Croatia, Iraq, and El Nino Savings Bonds.
