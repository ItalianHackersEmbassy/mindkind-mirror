    Allo, Luke. Laura et al? Prime Anarchist here. Your Libertarian at
Large. Or was that Librarian on the Luge? Or was that Thespian on the
Thames???
    INSURED UP TO 100,000.? Yeah, right!!! Remember the old-time bike with
the huge thin front wheel, and the little wimpy wheel in the back? Know what
it's called? Penny Farthing Bicycle. This trivial thought, petty poop, and
little luckypiece brought to you by P A P.
    Sign on a park bench, "NO GOVERNMENT WILL BRING YOU FREEDOM," Yippie!!!
I recommend Earl Grey tea over Celestial Seasons or English Breakfast-then
again, nothing beats a good (FLASH-- this just in. Prime Anarchist changes
his tea-stance. "I get a bigger kick out of English Breakfast now. Anyone
who can make something in Pencil-Vein-Yah, and call themselves English has
my vote!!! Had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Eating white bread
is like chawing on a soft sugary sponge.
    The DIAMOND VISA CARD. A 50,000 limit. Lets you buy stocks and bonds.
No commission-- just a 29$ service charge with each transaction. Hmm. What
made the 29-crash??? Fronted bucks!! Hmmm...
    If anyone wantsa do a movie about George Bush, John-Boy Walton would
make about a great choice to play our illustry yuss Prez-Phez. When
restringing a guitar, always wear something around your arms. Nasty slices
are no fun.
    Dr. Hunter S. Thompson freed, film at 11-ish.
    TomTom Club is getting back together. At long last, some old-timers
re-onioning I can tolerate.

    FLASH, FLASH, FLASH. (hey, cut it out. that hurts your eyes) World Will
End; And You May Die.  James Baker (not the jailed preacherman-prophet-
pudpuller-pee, but might as well be (the sik of state)), in a sudden
turn of back on national tv, told both sides of the gaza strip (dont ask
for an 8 oz gaza strip (medium-well) at a kosher restaurant.) "our fone #
is still 1-202-456-1414. If you feel like talking about peace sometime,
give us a call." Now, I'm not saying we should continue our orgiatic
lovemaking with either side but we've been in bed with Israel for 42 years
now, and mother earth has stayed-together-at-her-seams so far DESPITE all
our efforts to plunder, pillage and petrify. You know what the Bible says
about cursing Israel? Uh oh...
    Welp, that's about it for now. Tune in next week when Prime interviews
a friend of a friend of a real beatnik. We'll have more phun #'s, and we'll
bring you "all the viewz that fits in a bag lady's shopping cart".
    Hasta Banana..Buenos Tacos.............
