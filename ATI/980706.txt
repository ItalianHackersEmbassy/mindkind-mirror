Greetings, and welcome to ATI, Active Televised Ignorance.
Issue 135. The Honorable Judge Frank Mention presiding.
It is currently July 5, 1998. 2am. I'm Prime Anarchist
and this is "the shit."
   First a Parody; and then my column. Then you get lots and lots of
K-rad submissions. Nah, make the parody my column. Yeah.

So much life to be lived.
So much to be tried.
And when you share it you get
A special feeling inside.

It's a full time thing
The kind of life that you lead
A little break from it all
Is the break that you need.

You deserve a break today.
So get up and get away.
>From McDonalds.
Eat something else instead.
