Hi there,
It's been a while since I've sent out a short bulletin like this.

Methinks this one is a douzy. Doozy? Dousie, doozie; whatever.
You might wish to take this one sitting down.

Cutting To The Short Of It All (english)

Here come three words for why Lieberman will handle this with kid gloves
the whole way through.

Documents will be shredded, wrists will be slapped,
scapegoats will be singled out, and soon we will
all be back to business as usual.

Why?

I'll give you three words. Search them in google
and read yourself blind. Make sure you have something
uplifting near you the whole time. This will all
be depressing as sin.

Enron. Malaysia. Mafia.

What profits the people
Who have almost everything
Yet still they must
Steal from the poor

Qué beneficia la gente
Que pueden tener todo
Pero todavía deben robar
De nuestro más pobre
