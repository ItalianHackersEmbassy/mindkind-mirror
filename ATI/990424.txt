Happy Birthday to Mumia Abu Jamal, 
Paul Ryder and David J -
and a belated birthday to Abbie 
Hoffman, Alabama Sturgeon and
Adolf Hitler. May none of you 
ever be forgotten. Even the yucky 
ones.

Hard going down isn't it?
Hi, I'm prime anarchist and 
this is my column for saturday, 
the almostfullmoon of april.
The numbers run is short, we have 
a few short letters, and we've 
pushed back some of the others 
until next week, so that we can 
have room for the entire birthday
present that Marcos sent to Mumia 
Abu-Jamal this afternoon.
I publish the English version 
only for two reasons.
    1) None of us are good enough 
       at "traducciones" yet.
       Give us time! We're working 
       treadmills on it - swear.
    2) Too much more would make our 
       weekly zine much fatter
       than we promised.
    OK there's a 3:
    There is a dream and a vision of 
    this 'zine growing organically into 
    a 100% bona-fide bilingual publication. 
    No lip-service paragraph or two at the 
    back "en espanol," no one or two best
    picture captions hoping that "THEY'LL 
    get at LEAST THAT little BIT out of 
    us..." The vision is that the tongue
    of this 'zine would once a week be 
    translated evenly into two languages: 
    ingles, y espanol; english and 
    spanish. Until then, I (the zine) 
    remain "anglo."
    For all who are "with this vision" 
    I ask one thing.
    KEEP HELPING ME LEARN THE 
    SPANISH IN THE OFF TIME!!!

thank you, thank you,
