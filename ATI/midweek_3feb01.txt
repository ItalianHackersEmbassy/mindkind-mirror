Subject: [ati] a very important errata

[errata]

In the 'zine that just went out,
http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/ATI/ati262.txt
our quote:

As the movement grows, and as the status quo worsens,
the line between hackers and activists is erased.

Was listed (c)2001 Aries de la Cruz. Sharerights extended to all.

and it needs to be:

In the words of the old AT&T Bell Labs Speech Synthesized
recording, "please, make a note, of it."

To any of you who regularly forward this 'zine all over the place,
please make sure you're "moving" the one with copyleft, and not
copyright, ok?

Thanks.

This is very important to the author,
so of course it's equally important
to me.

Yours,
