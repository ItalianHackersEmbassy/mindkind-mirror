"Bimbo Buys Five U.S. Bakeries"
  That's the headline of the millenium I think.
Bimbo is whitebread in Mexico. Now they're
branching out. Among other things, they'll be
making and distributing your Orowheat bread,
Entenmann's pastries, Thomas' English Muffins
and Boboli pizza kits.

Lo siento, disculpame, sorry.
ATI hasn't published the past few weeks.

Have you missed us?

We're settling into a new international headquarters,
a new city, a new homeless shelter.

Hopefully soon we can put out or first next issue.
Plenty to write about so it should be fun.

Stand by, operators are dialing now.
