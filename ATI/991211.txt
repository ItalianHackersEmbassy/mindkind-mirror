What's the moon look like?

I put in my Badi Assad album and begin marking
up ATI. I realize I didn't watch SNL this week.
What did I miss?

This week's Activist Times 'zine sees Yvonne
Magdaline as Mary. The role of Primanikus will
be played by Morris the Cat.



If your theatre's not an IMAX - you're missing
out. Or are you? NA MU MYO HO REN GE KYO
  Who sang "King of the Jews" in Jesus Christ
Superstar - was it Randy Newman? Well, was it?

   Another message for the bishop. So do you
serve a king or a pawn? Well, do you? Do you?
And now, Sherwood Schwartz w/ the new multi-
racial Gilligan's Island!

this world? Can 'ya? Can 'ya?? 
  Evita, Is this really the end, or just Andrew 
Lloyd Cartel week? I expect Roller Derby anyday now.
Count on it. Marc my words. Californication:
Somebody's throwing way too much at the Chili
Peppers. Cher?

Hi I'm Prime Anarchist and this is ATI, Activist
Truth, Industries. This is issue 202. The "just
B-4 the y2k edition." MiLKenium. Heaven is truth,
your lies are your own personal hell, huh? Bring
it on peeps, bring it on. I like this transparency
routine. Good stuff. And they say, the truth shall
read you. 12dec99. Like a book.

Some say the activists won in Seattle this year.
Some say Buchanan. No one says the police state
gets the decision. Not even the police state 
himself. WTO? Can you say tail up your butt?
The long dusty whining trail home?

Santa Claus is doing well. Prices are at an
all-time stagnant. There's going to be some
happy kids around this planet. They can breath
a little easier now that, Hey, where are all
the trees? Who shaved all the thneeds???

Can you hear it? There's a message in the air
2nite. It's loud. Generation X is yelling it.
Gen who? What? You're kidding me! Those silly
silent slackers? They said what??? To who? 
You've got to be kidding me. 

Purpose. Hmmm. The world may end 2morrow, and
you will die. Well you will. So will I. Someday.
Not tomorrow, not next week. For now there is
happy. Happy happy, joy joy. I put Badi Assad
on repeat. NA MU MYO HO REN GE KYO!
