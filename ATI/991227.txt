Happy holidaze everybody. I'm prime
anarchist and I'm typing this on the text
editor that comes with LINUX. Can't wait
until I'm behind the learning curve running
it myself!!! Thanx, Sisyphus for this editor
shell. I guess I should say
   this issue in its
   entire T is dedicated
   to Sisyphus.
   & nice screensaver
   btw: I think I like
   the one in the middle
   best.
Nite B4 last I played Santa Klauz. That was
neato. I felt like the big phat red&white
Kachina for two hours. The best part was
knowing that for the moment, everyone believes
in me. And even the ones who don't? Well for
the moment, even they do too. Yeah! Go feel it
sometime if you haven't yet. It's pretty awesome.
  & 2day was Kwaanza. Yeah, thank you Michael
Bradford. Good stuff. Unity near the full moonity,
in the community. Great to see. Great to be.
  
One gospel song you don't want to sing a capella
getting on an airplane right now - "There is a
balm in Gilead."

  Prime!
