           ATI MISSION STATEMENT
                    by Prime Anarchist.

There is only 1 acceptable purpose for technology:

Simply?

To improve life.

Lives of people, plants animals; people in jail, people in the air,
people in the water.

Winged and legged. "Things" that just set there. Every single atom
on Mother Earth is sacred. If any technology works against one single
thing's harmony with another:

YOU'RE USING IT WRONG.

"Make your adjustments and get back to me."
