                        40Hex Online

40Hex has existed as an online magazine since June 1991.  The magazine
has changed management several times and has consequently gone through
many stages.  However, the purpose of the magazine has always been to
distribute information on the computer virus phenomenon in an uncensored
forum.  40Hex online has become the most popular virus magazine in the
underground.

     40Hex magazine is now also available in hardcopy format.  The two
magazines will not contain the same articles, as each medium is better
suited to a different audience and a different volume of information.
